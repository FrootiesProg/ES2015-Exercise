What is the difference between var and let?
'Let' is block scoped which means it is only accessible within the block where it is declared.
'Var' is a function scoped which means it is accesible throughout the entire function where it is declared regardless of the block scoped variable.*/

What is the difference between var and const?
'Const' allows you to declared a variable with a constant, unchangeable value and once it is declared it cannot be reassigined or changed like 'let'.
'Var' allows you to declare a variable and reassigin variables and can be changed throughout the entire function.

What is the difference between let and const?
'Const' allows you to declare a variable that cannot be reassigined and once it is declared.
'Let' allows you to declare a variables with a new value and once it is declared.

What is hoisting?
Hoisting is a JS behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. 
This means that you can use variables or functions before they are actually declared. However, only the declarations are hoisted not the ininitalization.
If you try to access the value of a variable before it is declared you will get an error.
Function declarations are hoisted entirely, allowing you to call functions even before their actual declaration in the code.
